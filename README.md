# Awesome-AI-Policy
A curated list of AI policies and documents

I think we need an “Awesome” of useful documents related to the AI policies and other public efforts in this field such as roadmaps, regulations, official reports. But it is not possible without having a nice community that works on it. This “Awesome” will help us to:
 1. Being updated! Currently and unlike the early stages and early years, we are not speaking about some initiatives of limited countries in AI. Every day, some progress in AI policymaking is happening. By developing an “Awesome”, we together and as a community will have a chance to follow the changes as soon as possible.

 2. Better understanding! Most policies, regulations, and important reports which are developed in countries are in their hometown language and have roots in their context. Here we have the opportunity to find someone who explains them more accurately.
 3. Being inclusive. There are lots of efforts and like this awesome to build a directory of policies, but most of them focused on a specific region or countries which are a member of an international organization. Here we try to look at whole world countries. 
 4. Finally, here we try to look at and classify the document with a policymaking point of view.
