# Contributing

Dear friends 
Your contributions are always welcome!
Here I try to set some simple guidelines that I think they will help us to develop and contribute to this repository in a better way. Please feel free to feedback about these guidelines. 

## General guidelines:
- Please note this repository contains 2 main types of documents, 1) documents that are officially or non-officially reporting about country policies and plans. 2) Useful documents for researchers that are structured in a scheme that may be helpful for public policy practitioners.
Everyone who joins us, can report about countries' policies and plans (especially his or her own country) or share documents that think can be helpful for others. 
Furthermore, you may find some documents wrong or not useful. You can suggest correcting or deleting them from the list.
The first, and foremost important contribution that we need, is adding useful documents, especially those are not easily accessible and reachable for other researchers due to the language and or complications in the publication of organizational documents and national policies


- Another help is Translating documents to English. It looks that we are only aware of the developments in English-speaking countries or the countries that are members of the International Organization(Such as OECD or EU). A significant number of National policies and plans are not translated into English. I hope, here we find contributors in different nations and they help us for better understanding about what is happening in their countries. 
Second, we use tags to briefly report the contents selected here. When you are adding new documents you should use them. Also, you can correct the tags assigned to other documents or add a new one to report details that may be forgotten.
 
- If you are an organization you can add your logo to this repository for a year by releasing news about this repository on your website, newsletter, or any other communication channel.

- last but not least, Your generous help can be introducing this repository to your friends and other persons who are interested in AI and AI Policies. You can find social networks IDs at the bottom of this page. 

# Detail guidelines: 
- Please add documents in alphabetical order. It helps others know if a document is already added or not.
- Please Pay attention to grammar.
- If you a country or topic has only one document link, add the tags under the link. If a topic or country has more than one link, please add tags at the end of the link.
